# 🌲 Cypress, do Zero à Nuvem ☁️

Sample project for the "Cypress, from Zero to the Cloud".

### Pre-requirements
It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

I used versions v18.15.0 and 9.5.0 of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

### Installation
Run npm install (or npm i for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

### Tests
Note: Before running the tests, make a copy of the cypress.env.example.json file as cypress.env.json, which in the real world, you would update with valid credentials.

The cypress.env.json file is included on .gitignore and you're safe that confidential info won't be versioned.

Run npm test (or npm t for the short version) to run the test in headless mode.

Or, run npm run cy:open to open Cypress in interactive mode.
